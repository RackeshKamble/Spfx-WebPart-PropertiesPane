# SPFX WebPart Properties Pane Demonstaration

The property pane consists of the 3 elements. 
• Pages 
• Headers 
• Groups

Custom props should be in interface as well as in render method 
Then in preconfigured entries in manifest.json file

We have also explored custom control e.g. Dropdown + Non Reactive Field Events on Apply Button click
We then handled webpart properties validations to sum it up..
